00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:03,06


Agile is a very broad term for a family



2

00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:05,03

of project life cycles.



3

00:00:05,03 --> 00:00:07,08

All of these approaches share their foundation



4

00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:11,09

in lean methods, where the focus is on eliminating wasteful



5

00:00:11,09 --> 00:00:14,01

or non-valuable work.



6

00:00:14,01 --> 00:00:16,07

For a full discussion of the agile mindset



7

00:00:16,07 --> 00:00:19,02

and all the different ways it can be used,



8

00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:22,00

check out the course Agile Foundations.



9

00:00:22,00 --> 00:00:24,00

To keep our discussion here brief,



10

00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:26,08

we'll pick just one way the agile mindset



11

00:00:26,08 --> 00:00:28,03

is put into practice.



12

00:00:28,03 --> 00:00:31,05

The most common framework is scrum.



13

00:00:31,05 --> 00:00:34,02

So, how does scrum begin?



14

00:00:34,02 --> 00:00:38,04

Well, there's an assumption from the scrum mindset



15

00:00:38,04 --> 00:00:41,09

that your organization already has a process in place



16

00:00:41,09 --> 00:00:43,08

for projects to get approved.



17

00:00:43,08 --> 00:00:48,03

This does not dictate how you initiate your projects,



18

00:00:48,03 --> 00:00:51,00

all it says is that when you have those



19

00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:53,05

processes established in your organization,



20

00:00:53,05 --> 00:00:55,07

it should be efficient, it should be quick,



21

00:00:55,07 --> 00:00:58,05

and it shouldn't burden the team or the stakeholders



22

00:00:58,05 --> 00:01:01,04

with unnecessary or wasteful work.



23

00:01:01,04 --> 00:01:04,02

In scrum, there are three key players,



24

00:01:04,02 --> 00:01:07,08

and the product owner is arguably the most important one.



25

00:01:07,08 --> 00:01:10,02

The product owner, or PO for short,



26

00:01:10,02 --> 00:01:14,02

is the business and stakeholder rep for the team.



27

00:01:14,02 --> 00:01:18,00

They're really the glue that takes the idea of the product



28

00:01:18,00 --> 00:01:20,09

or project and links it with the team



29

00:01:20,09 --> 00:01:24,00

because they're deciding what is the most valuable work



30

00:01:24,00 --> 00:01:26,08

that this team needs to do.



31

00:01:26,08 --> 00:01:30,00

Another key player is the scrum master.



32

00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:33,08

This individual owns the scrum process.



33

00:01:33,08 --> 00:01:36,08

They control the framework



34

00:01:36,08 --> 00:01:39,01

and how the team applies the framework



35

00:01:39,01 --> 00:01:40,07

as they're doing the work.



36

00:01:40,07 --> 00:01:44,03

They help the team to deliver as much as possible



37

00:01:44,03 --> 00:01:48,01

with high quality and a focus on the detail



38

00:01:48,01 --> 00:01:50,04

of the work execution.



39

00:01:50,04 --> 00:01:54,05

Finally, the next key player is the scrum team.



40

00:01:54,05 --> 00:01:57,09

The scrum team is a cross-functional group of individuals.



41

00:01:57,09 --> 00:02:00,04

They have all the skills needed



42

00:02:00,04 --> 00:02:04,00

to complete the work in the product backlog.



43

00:02:04,00 --> 00:02:07,05

The PO is the one requesting the work to be done,



44

00:02:07,05 --> 00:02:12,02

the team is the one deciding how to accomplish this work.



45

00:02:12,02 --> 00:02:15,02

So, in scrum, how do they actually do their work?



46

00:02:15,02 --> 00:02:17,04

Well, they don't have phases.



47

00:02:17,04 --> 00:02:19,08

They use time boxes, or sprints,



48

00:02:19,08 --> 00:02:22,01

and sprints are usually two weeks,



49

00:02:22,01 --> 00:02:24,08

and they keep cycling through sprint after sprint



50

00:02:24,08 --> 00:02:27,07

after sprint until all the project work is done,



51

00:02:27,07 --> 00:02:31,06

or all the requests from the product owner are complete.



52

00:02:31,06 --> 00:02:35,09

So, it sounds very loose, but they do stay organized.



53

00:02:35,09 --> 00:02:38,05

There are two ways that scrum teams stay organized,



54

00:02:38,05 --> 00:02:40,07

they use artifacts and they use ceremonies.



55

00:02:40,07 --> 00:02:43,00

Artifacts are just documents,



56

00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:44,04

and ceremonies are the meetings



57

00:02:44,04 --> 00:02:46,09

that they use to coordinate their activities.



58

00:02:46,09 --> 00:02:48,06

So, let's talk a little bit about the kinds



59

00:02:48,06 --> 00:02:51,02

of artifacts that the scrum team uses.



60

00:02:51,02 --> 00:02:53,02

Well, the first, and probably the most important,



61

00:02:53,02 --> 00:02:55,00

is the product backlog.



62

00:02:55,00 --> 00:02:58,08

This is the long list of work that the PO wants completed.



63

00:02:58,08 --> 00:03:01,01

The team, then, works with the product owner



64

00:03:01,01 --> 00:03:04,09

to select a subset of this to create the next artifact,



65

00:03:04,09 --> 00:03:06,06

which is the sprint backlog.



66

00:03:06,06 --> 00:03:08,01

What's in the sprint backlog is



67

00:03:08,01 --> 00:03:09,06

what the team is actually committing



68

00:03:09,06 --> 00:03:12,03

to for the next two-week period.



69

00:03:12,03 --> 00:03:15,04

Finally, there's the product increment itself.



70

00:03:15,04 --> 00:03:18,03

The increment is the embodiment of all the work



71

00:03:18,03 --> 00:03:20,01

that's completed in the current sprint



72

00:03:20,01 --> 00:03:22,07

and all the previous sprints.



73

00:03:22,07 --> 00:03:25,08

So, how do they coordinate their work with each other?



74

00:03:25,08 --> 00:03:28,02

Well, let's talk about the ceremonies they use.



75

00:03:28,02 --> 00:03:29,08

There are five of them.



76

00:03:29,08 --> 00:03:32,04

The first is the sprint itself, it's a ceremony.



77

00:03:32,04 --> 00:03:35,04

It has a start and an end, and it lasts about two weeks.



78

00:03:35,04 --> 00:03:38,02

Next is a ceremony called sprint planning.



79

00:03:38,02 --> 00:03:40,06

Within sprint planning, the team comes together



80

00:03:40,06 --> 00:03:42,05

with the scrum master and the product owner



81

00:03:42,05 --> 00:03:46,06

and they define what are they going to finish this sprint,



82

00:03:46,06 --> 00:03:48,06

and they make a commitment to that.



83

00:03:48,06 --> 00:03:52,00

Then, every day, they have the next ceremony,



84

00:03:52,00 --> 00:03:53,03

which is the daily scrum.



85

00:03:53,03 --> 00:03:55,08

The team comes together every day and says,



86

00:03:55,08 --> 00:03:58,04

this is what I did yesterday, this is what I'm doing today,



87

00:03:58,04 --> 00:04:00,08

and this is where I could use some help.



88

00:04:00,08 --> 00:04:03,02

Next there's the sprint review, or the demo,



89

00:04:03,02 --> 00:04:04,06

that they do at the end.



90

00:04:04,06 --> 00:04:07,01

This is where they show the product owner



91

00:04:07,01 --> 00:04:09,07

and the stakeholders everything that they've completed



92

00:04:09,07 --> 00:04:13,03

and make sure that it's up to their expectations.



93

00:04:13,03 --> 00:04:16,00

Finally, the last ceremony the team uses



94

00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:17,08

is the sprint retrospective.



95

00:04:17,08 --> 00:04:20,08

This is where they really become very internally focused



96

00:04:20,08 --> 00:04:24,00

and they say, what did we do really well in the sprint?



97

00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:26,06

How do we capitalize on that and do more of it?



98

00:04:26,06 --> 00:04:29,06

What didn't go so well for us, and how do we change it?



99

00:04:29,06 --> 00:04:32,02

And finally, what changes do we want to commit



100

00:04:32,02 --> 00:04:34,02

to in the future sprints?



101

00:04:34,02 --> 00:04:37,03

The scrum process is really easy to understand.



102

00:04:37,03 --> 00:04:41,04

It is, however, hard to master and do well.



103

00:04:41,04 --> 00:04:43,07

Using these artifacts and ceremonies,



104

00:04:43,07 --> 00:04:46,08

the team can deliver value very quickly.
